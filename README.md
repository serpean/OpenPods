## DO NOT REUPLOAD TO GOOGLE PLAY
**This app violates Google Play policies and is designed to break if you try to fix that unless you really know what you're doing.** You have been warned. I do NOT want this app to be on Google Play.

I had to do this because several people were redistributing modified proprietary versions of this app on Google Play in violation of the GNU GPLv3 license.
